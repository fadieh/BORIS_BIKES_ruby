# Week 1 - Boris Bikes

This is the first project from the get-go from the Makers Academy Sept  '14 curriculum from Day 1 - 4 / 60. It introduced us to Object-Orientated Programming using Ruby and testing with RSpec.

As deduced from the title, it is a simulation of the Barclays Cycle Hire scheme throughout Central London that contains seperate classes for Bikes, Docking Stations, Vans, Garages and People.

I really enjoyed this as a first task and it was the start of my new love story with programming which got me really excited for the road ahead.
